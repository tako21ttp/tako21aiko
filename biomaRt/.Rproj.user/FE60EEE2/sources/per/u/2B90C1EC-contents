# Every analysis with biomaRt starts with selecting a BioMart database to use. The commands below will connect us to Ensemblâ€™s most recent version of the Human Genes BioMart.

# If this your first time using biomaRt , you might wonder how to find the two arguments we supplied to the useEnsembl() command. This is a two step process, but once you know the setting you need you can use the version shown above as a single command. These initial steps are outlined below.
